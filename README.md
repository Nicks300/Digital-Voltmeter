# Digital Voltmeter Software Overview

## üõ†Ô∏è Introduction  
A digital voltmeter is an essential tool for accurately measuring and displaying voltage levels in electrical circuits. It operates by converting an analog voltage signal into a digital value for processing and display. The system typically consists of:  
- **Hardware Components**: Analog-to-Digital Converter (ADC) and a display interface (e.g., LCD).  
- **Microcontroller (MCU)**: Governs the operations and ensures seamless communication between components.

This document provides an overview of the software functionality that enables the digital voltmeter's real-time and precise operation.

## üìã Software Functionality  

Upon power-up, the microcontroller (MCU) performs the following tasks:  

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Initialization  
- Sets up the **Analog-to-Digital Converter (ADC)** for voltage sampling.  
- Configures the **Inter-Integrated Circuit (I2C)** communication interface to transmit data to the display.  

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Continuous Operation Loop  
The software enters a continuous loop to ensure ongoing operation as long as the device is powered:  
- **Signal Sampling**: The ADC continuously samples the input voltage signal.  
- **Signal Conversion**: Converts the analog signal into a digital format.  
- **Data Processing**: Processes the digital data to extract meaningful voltage readings.  
- **Data Display**: Transmits processed data to the LCD screen via the I2C interface for real-time display.  

This process enables real-time data acquisition and user-friendly presentation of voltage readings.
